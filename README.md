Welcome to the workshop. If you haven't already followed the initial setup that was sent out by mail (due to unforeseen events or just laziness 🦥), please start with the section PREPARATION. Otherwise you will find the tasks in the following sections. Happy hacking! 😄

- The structure of the project has already been created for you. Just work in the files provided in this repository.

## Task 1 - Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- 1.1 Run `gcloud auth application-default login` to store you credentials for GCP locally (the Terraform Google provider needs them for authentication)

- 3.3. In the main.tf in the base folder use the module to create both resources
- 3.4 Define the self links to the resources in the outputs.tf file
  
## Task 4 - Terraform Remote State
- 4.1 Follow the TFE_SETUP.md and connect your repository to TFE
- 4.2 Inspect the state file remotely
- 4.3 Use the terraform CLI and inspect the state file again
  
## Task 5 - Data Sources - bucket.tf
